# Medical Device FHIR Integration Platform

## Overview

A fully deployable reference architecture that unifies clinical EHR data (FHIR R4), real-time medical device telemetry (Masimo pulse oximeters), and DICOM medical imaging into Microsoft Fabric for unified clinical analytics and AI-powered patient insights.

### Problem

Healthcare organizations cannot correlate fragmented data across EHR systems (FHIR), device gateways (telemetry), and imaging archives (PACS/DICOM). Clinicians cannot ask cross-domain questions like *"Show SpO2 trends for patients with COPD who have recent chest CTs"* because data lives in separate systems with no common query layer.

### Solution

A single Microsoft Fabric workspace that:
- Ingests 5M+ FHIR R4 clinical resources via Healthcare Data Solutions
- Streams real-time pulse oximeter telemetry through Event Hub → Eventstream → Eventhouse
- Loads DICOM medical imaging via OneLake shortcuts to ADLS Gen2
- Deploys AI Data Agents for natural-language clinical queries across all data domains
- Transforms data through HDS pipelines: Clinical → Imaging → OMOP CDM v5.4

---

## Goals

| ID | Goal | Success Metric |
|----|------|---------------|
| G1 | Unify clinical + telemetry + imaging in one platform | All 3 data streams queryable from single workspace |
| G2 | Enable real-time clinical alerting | SpO2/PR alerts generated within 30s of telemetry receipt |
| G3 | Deploy end-to-end with single command | `Deploy-All.ps1` completes Phase 1 in <60 min |
| G4 | Support natural-language clinical queries | Data Agents answer cross-datasource questions accurately |
| G5 | Demonstrate OMOP CDM transformation | Gold Lakehouse populated with OMOP v5.4 tables |
| G6 | Fully idempotent deployment | Re-running any script produces no errors or duplicates |
| G7 | Clean teardown | All Azure + Fabric + Entra resources removed in <10 min |

## Constraints

| Constraint | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| HDS requires manual portal deployment | Cannot fully automate end-to-end | Two-phase approach with pre-populated Phase 2 command |
| Fabric shortcuts need RBAC propagation | First attempt may fail with 401 | 3-attempt retry with 60s backoff |
| Azure Policy may block SAS auth | Event Hub cloud connection fails | `-Tags @{SecurityControl='Ignore'}` applied to namespace |
| Kusto tokens expire after ~60 min | KQL operations fail mid-deployment | Token refresh before Phase 2a operations |
| TCIA rate limits | Large downloads may timeout | Retry logic + configurable study count |
| Data Agents can't cross-join | No single query across KQL + SQL | Agents run separate queries, correlate in response |

---

## Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Azure Policy blocks deployment | High | Blocks Event Hub, storage shortcuts | SecurityControl tag parameterized on all resources |
| HDS deployment changes | Medium | Manual steps may differ | HDS-SETUP-GUIDE.md maintained with current steps |
| Fabric API deprecation | Medium | Endpoints return 404 | Use `/items?type=X` generically, not type-specific endpoints |
| TCIA collection unavailable | Low | No DICOM data | Fallback to RSNA Pneumonia collection |
| Workspace identity stale | Medium | Shortcuts fail after teardown/recreate | Fabric API identity resolution + Entra cleanup |
