# CMS Quality & Claims Integration Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan adds **claims/insurance data** and **CMS quality measurement** capabilities to the Medical Device FHIR Integration Platform. We leverage Synthea's built-in claims generation (ExplanationOfBenefit, Claim, Coverage), add new Fabric tables, extend the ontology with payer/provider entities inspired by the [Fabric-Payer-Provider-HealthCare-Demo](https://github.com/rasgiza/Fabric-Payer-Provider-HealthCare-Demo), and create a Power BI report for CMS quality analytics.

## Part 1: Claims Data Generation — What Synthea Already Does

### Synthea Natively Generates Claims

Synthea **already generates** claims-related FHIR R4 resources — we just aren't including them. The current `synthea.properties` explicitly filters resources via `exporter.fhir.included_resources`, excluding claims types.

**Currently included:**
```
Patient,Encounter,Condition,Observation,Procedure,MedicationRequest,
Immunization,DiagnosticReport,CarePlan,CareTeam,AllergyIntolerance,
Organization,Practitioner,PractitionerRole,Location
```

**What Synthea generates but we're excluding:**
| FHIR Resource | What It Contains |
|--------------|-----------------|
| `Claim` | Individual healthcare claim submitted for an encounter (billing codes, amounts) |
| `ExplanationOfBenefit` (EOB) | Adjudicated claim — what was billed, what the payer covered, what the patient owes (the richest resource) |
| `Coverage` | Patient insurance coverage details (payer, plan, period, subscriber) |

### How to Enable Claims Generation

**Change 1** — Update `synthea/synthea.properties`:
```properties
# Add claims resources to the included list
exporter.fhir.included_resources = Patient,Encounter,Condition,Observation,Procedure,MedicationRequest,Immunization,DiagnosticReport,CarePlan,CareTeam,AllergyIntolerance,Organization,Practitioner,PractitionerRole,Location,Claim,ExplanationOfBenefit,Coverage
```

That's it for generation. Synthea's built-in health economics engine handles:
- **Cost assignment**: Triangular distribution from procedure/medication/encounter cost tables
- **Payer assignment**: Patients are assigned to Medicare, Medicaid, or private payers based on demographics/eligibility
- **Claims adjudication**: Each encounter generates a Claim → ExplanationOfBenefit with billed/allowed/paid amounts
- **Coverage periods**: Coverage resources track insurance enrollment periods

### What the EOB Contains (Key Fields for Quality)

Each `ExplanationOfBenefit` links:
- `patient` → Patient reference
- `provider` → Organization/Practitioner reference
- `facility` → Location reference
- `insurance.coverage` → Coverage reference (payer)
- `item[]` → Line items with CPT/HCPCS codes, service dates, costs
- `item[].adjudication[]` → Billed, allowed, paid, copay, deductible amounts
- `diagnosis[]` → ICD-10 codes (principal + secondary)
- `procedure[]` → Procedure codes performed
- `total[]` → Claim-level totals (billed, paid, patient responsibility)
- `type` → institutional | professional | pharmacy | oral
- `outcome` → complete | partial | error

## Part 2: CMS Quality Measures — What They Actually Check

### What is CQL / eCQM?

**Clinical Quality Language (CQL)** is the ANSI-certified expression language used by CMS to define **electronic Clinical Quality Measures (eCQMs)**. Since 2019, CMS requires all eCQM specifications to use CQL.

Each eCQM defines:
- **Initial Population (IP)**: Who is eligible to be measured (age, condition, encounter type)
- **Denominator**: Subset of IP that should receive the care
- **Numerator**: Subset of denominator that actually received the correct care
- **Exclusions/Exceptions**: Valid reasons for not meeting the measure

**Quality Rate = Numerator / Denominator × 100%**

### CMS Quality Measures Relevant to Our Patient Population

Given our Synthea modules (asthma, COPD, CHF, COVID-19, metabolic syndrome, lung cancer), these CMS/HEDIS measures are directly applicable:

#### Tier 1 — Measures We Can Compute from Existing + Claims Data

| Measure ID | Name | What It Checks | Data Needed |
|-----------|------|---------------|-------------|
| **CMS122v12** | Diabetes: Hemoglobin A1c Poor Control | % of diabetic patients 18-75 with HbA1c > 9% or no test | Condition (diabetes dx), Observation (HbA1c labs), Encounter, Coverage |
| **CMS165v12** | Controlling High Blood Pressure | % of hypertensive patients 18-85 with BP < 140/90 | Condition (HTN dx), Observation (BP readings), Encounter |
| **CMS134v12** | Diabetes: Medical Attention for Nephropathy | % of diabetic patients with nephropathy screening/treatment | Condition, Observation (urine albumin), MedicationRequest (ACE/ARB) |
| **CMS69v12** | Preventive Care: BMI Screening | % of patients 18+ with BMI recorded and follow-up plan | Observation (BMI), Encounter |
| **CMS127v12** | Pneumococcal Vaccination Status | % of patients 65+ who received pneumococcal vaccine | Immunization, Patient (age), Encounter |
| **CMS147v13** | Preventive Care: Influenza Immunization | % of patients 6mo+ who received flu vaccine | Immunization, Encounter |
| **CMS156v12** | Use of High-Risk Medications in Older Adults | % of patients 65+ prescribed ≥2 high-risk meds | MedicationRequest, Patient (age) |

#### Tier 2 — Measures Enhanced by Claims/EOB Data

| Measure ID | Name | Claims Value-Add |
|-----------|------|-----------------|
| **CMS159v12** | Depression Remission or Response | Claims show follow-up encounters happened and were billed |
| **CMS144v12** | Heart Failure: Beta-Blocker for LVSD | Claims confirm prescription fills (not just orders) via pharmacy claims |
| **CMS145v12** | Coronary Artery Disease: Beta-Blocker | Claims validate medication dispensing |
| **CMS135v12** | Heart Failure: ACE/ARB for LVSD | Claims confirm fill + adherence via PDC |

#### Tier 3 — HEDIS-Aligned Measures (Payer-Focused)

| HEDIS Measure | Name | Why It Matters |
|-------------|------|---------------|
| **PDC-DR** | Proportion of Days Covered — Diabetes | CMS Star Rating triple-weighted adherence measure |
| **PDC-RASA** | PDC — RAS Antagonists (ACE/ARB) | Star Rating triple-weighted |
| **PDC-STA** | PDC — Statins | Star Rating triple-weighted |
| **COL** | Colorectal Cancer Screening | Preventive care gap |
| **BCS** | Breast Cancer Screening | Preventive care gap |
| **CBP** | Controlling Blood Pressure | Overlaps CMS165 |
| **CDC** | Comprehensive Diabetes Care | Composite of CMS122/134 |

### How to Compute Quality Without a CQL Engine

Rather than running a full CQL evaluation engine, we can **translate the measure logic into SQL/KQL** since we know the exact data model. Each measure becomes a SQL query pattern:

```sql
-- Example: CMS122 — Diabetes HbA1c Poor Control
-- Denominator: Patients 18-75 with diabetes diagnosis + qualifying encounter in measurement year
-- Numerator: Those with most recent HbA1c > 9% OR no HbA1c test in measurement year

WITH denominator AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT p.patient_id
    FROM dim_patient p
    JOIN fact_claim c ON p.patient_key = c.patient_key
    JOIN fact_diagnosis d ON c.encounter_key = d.encounter_key
    WHERE d.icd_code LIKE 'E11%'  -- Type 2 Diabetes
      AND p.age BETWEEN 18 AND 75
      AND c.claim_date_key >= @measurement_year_start
),
latest_hba1c AS (
    SELECT patient_id, MAX(observation_value) as last_hba1c
    FROM fact_observation
    WHERE loinc_code = '4548-4'  -- HbA1c
      AND effective_date >= @measurement_year_start
    GROUP BY patient_id
)
SELECT 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN h.last_hba1c > 9.0 OR h.last_hba1c IS NULL THEN 1 END) as numerator,
    COUNT(*) as denominator,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(CASE WHEN h.last_hba1c > 9.0 OR h.last_hba1c IS NULL THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*), 1) as rate
FROM denominator d
LEFT JOIN latest_hba1c h ON d.patient_id = h.patient_id
```

## Part 4: Ontology Extension — New Entities from Payer-Provider Demo

### Entities to Add (Inspired by rasgiza/Fabric-Payer-Provider-HealthCare-Demo)

Comparing our current 9-entity `ClinicalDeviceOntology` with the Payer-Provider demo's 12-entity ontology, these entities are directly relevant:

| New Entity | Source Table | Applicable? | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Claim** | `fact_claim` | **YES** | Core claims entity with denial risk, amounts, payer link |
| **Payer** | `dim_payer` | **YES** | Insurance carrier dimension — enables payer-level quality analysis |
| **Diagnosis** | `dim_diagnosis` | **YES** | ICD-10 dimension — enables condition-based quality filtering |
| **Prescription** | `fact_claim_line` (pharmacy type) | **MAYBE** | We already have MedicationRequest; pharmacy claims add fill/adherence data |
| **MedicationAdherence** | `agg_medication_adherence` | **YES** | PDC scores for Star Rating measures — critical for CMS quality |
| **CommunityHealth (SDOH)** | Not in scope yet | **FUTURE** | Zip-code-level social determinants — powerful for equity analysis |
| **PatientDiagnosis** | `fact_diagnosis` | **YES** | Bridge entity linking patients ↔ encounters ↔ diagnoses with sequence/type |

### New Ontology Relationships

| Relationship | Source → Target | Join Logic |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| **Patient hasClaim** | Patient → Claim | `Patient.patientId = Claim.patient_key` |
| **Claim paidBy** | Claim → Payer | `Claim.payer_key = Payer.payer_key` |
| **Claim hasDiagnosis** | Claim → Diagnosis | via `fact_diagnosis` bridge |
| **Patient coveredBy** | Patient → Payer | via `Coverage` → `dim_payer` |
| **Patient hasDiagnosis** | Patient → PatientDiagnosis | `patient_key` |
| **PatientDiagnosis isDiagnosis** | PatientDiagnosis → Diagnosis | `diagnosis_key` |
| **Patient hasAdherence** | Patient → MedicationAdherence | `patient_key` |
| **Encounter hasDiagnosis** | Encounter → PatientDiagnosis | `encounter_key` |

### Updated Ontology Summary

| # | Entity | Source | Existing? |
|---|--------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Patient | Silver Lakehouse | ✅ Existing |
| 2 | Device | Silver Lakehouse | ✅ Existing |
| 3 | Encounter | Silver Lakehouse | ✅ Existing |
| 4 | Condition | Silver Lakehouse | ✅ Existing |
| 5 | MedicationRequest | Silver Lakehouse | ✅ Existing |
| 6 | Observation | Silver Lakehouse | ✅ Existing |
| 7 | DeviceAssociation | Silver Lakehouse | ✅ Existing |
| 8 | DeviceTelemetry | Eventhouse | ✅ Existing |
| 9 | ClinicalAlert | Eventhouse | ✅ Existing |
| 10 | **Claim** | Gold Lakehouse | 🆕 NEW |
| 11 | **Payer** | Gold Lakehouse | 🆕 NEW |
| 12 | **Diagnosis** | Gold Lakehouse | 🆕 NEW |
| 13 | **PatientDiagnosis** | Gold Lakehouse | 🆕 NEW |
| 14 | **MedicationAdherence** | Gold Lakehouse | 🆕 NEW |

**Total: 14 entities, 16 relationships** (up from 9 entities, 8 relationships)

### Page 6: Payer Performance
- **Bar Chart**: Quality rate by payer (Medicare vs Medicaid vs Commercial)
- **Matrix**: Measure performance by payer — conditional formatting
- **Scatter**: Denial rate vs quality rate by payer
- **KPI Cards**: Best/worst performing payer, payer with most care gaps

### Semantic Model Additions

New DAX measures for the `CMS Quality Scorecard` report:

```dax
// Quality Rate
Quality Rate = 
    DIVIDE(
        COUNTROWS(FILTER(agg_quality_measures, [quality_met] = 1)),
        COUNTROWS(FILTER(agg_quality_measures, [in_denominator] = 1)),
        0
    )

// Denial Rate
Denial Rate = 
    DIVIDE(
        COUNTROWS(FILTER(fact_claim, [denial_flag] = 1)),
        COUNTROWS(fact_claim),
        0
    )

// PDC Score (Proportion of Days Covered)
Avg PDC Score = AVERAGE(agg_medication_adherence[pdc_score])

// Open Care Gaps
Open Care Gaps = COUNTROWS(FILTER(care_gaps, [gap_status] = "open"))

// Collection Rate
Collection Rate = DIVIDE(SUM(fact_claim[paid_amount]), SUM(fact_claim[billed_amount]), 0)
```

## Part 6: Implementation Phases

### Phase A — Enable Claims in Synthea ✅ DONE
1. ✅ Update `synthea.properties` to include `Claim,ExplanationOfBenefit,Coverage`
2. ✅ FHIR Loader already handles all resource types — no changes needed
3. ✅ FHIR $export includes new resource types by default
4. ✅ HDS pipeline processes new resource types into Silver Lakehouse automatically

### Phase B+E — Create Gold Star Schema + Quality Computation ✅ DONE
1. ✅ Created `fabric-rti/sql/materialize_claims_quality.py` — combined materialization + quality
2. ✅ Built `dim_payer`, `dim_diagnosis`, `fact_claim`, `fact_diagnosis`
3. ✅ Computed 7 CMS eCQM quality measures → `agg_quality_measures`, `agg_quality_summary`
4. ✅ Computed 3 HEDIS PDC medication adherence scores → `agg_medication_adherence`
5. ✅ Identified care gaps → `care_gaps` with recommended clinical actions

### Phase C — Extend Ontology ✅ DONE
1. ✅ Added 5 new entity types (Claim, Payer, Diagnosis, PatientDiagnosis, MedAdherence) to Gold LH
2. ✅ Added 4 new relationship types (hasClaim, paidBy, hasDiagnosis, hasAdherence)
3. ✅ Updated `phase-4/deploy-ontology.ps1` with Gold LH auto-discovery + new entities
4. Agent instruction updates deferred to post-deployment testing

### Phase D — Power BI Report ✅ DONE
1. ✅ Created `CMS Quality Scorecard` semantic model (Direct Lake, 8 tables, 3 relationships)
2. ✅ Built 6-page report definition (TMDL + page.json)
3. ✅ Created 14 DAX measures in `_Measures.tmdl`
4. ✅ Integrated into Deploy-All.ps1 Phase 5 + orchestrator UI

### Orchestrator & Docs ✅ DONE
1. ✅ Added Phase 5 checkbox to DeployWizard + PhaseMonitor
2. ✅ Added mock deployment simulation (mockDeployment.ts)
3. ✅ Added `-Phase5` / `-SkipQualityMeasures` to Deploy-All.ps1
4. ✅ Created backend activity (`deploy_quality_measures.py`) + function_app.py wiring
5. ✅ Created `docs/phase-5-cms-quality-and-claims.md`
6. ✅ Updated README.md, CHANGELOG.md, TODO-ITEMS.MD

---

## Key Decisions — RESOLVED

1. **Re-run Synthea**: ✅ Generate claims with Synthea on next run (first-time or re-generation). No post-processing needed.

2. **Gold Lakehouse location**: ✅ Use existing `healthcare1_reporting_gold` Lakehouse (already created by Phase 3).

3. **Ontology binding**: ✅ Cross-lakehouse binding — existing entities bind to Silver LH + Eventhouse, new claims entities bind to Gold LH. Deploy-ontology.ps1 auto-discovers Gold LH.

4. **Quality measurement period**: ✅ Full 10 years (matches `exporter.years_of_history = 10` in synthea.properties).
